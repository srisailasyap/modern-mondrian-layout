Project Description:

The provided HTML and CSS code constitutes a web project titled "Mondrian Project." This project creates a visual representation inspired by the abstract works of Piet Mondrian, a Dutch artist known for his use of geometric shapes and primary colors. The project utilizes a combination of HTML and CSS to construct a responsive layout resembling Mondrian's iconic compositions.

Key Features:

Grid Layout: The project employs a grid layout using CSS Grid to organize the elements within a central container. The grid is structured with specified columns and rows, creating a visually organized and balanced composition.

Color Palette: The color palette is consistent with Mondrian's style, featuring primary colors such as red, blue, and yellow. The background of the container is black, contributing to the stark contrast typical of Mondrian's artworks.

Geometric Elements: Various div elements within the grid are styled to represent Mondrian's geometric shapes. The use of different classes defines the colors and sizes of these elements, mimicking the artist's abstract and minimalistic approach.

Responsive Design: The project incorporates responsive design principles, ensuring that the layout adjusts appropriately to different screen sizes. The container is centered on the page and occupies the entire viewport height.

By encapsulating Mondrian's artistic style into a web project, this endeavor offers an interactive and digital interpretation of his abstract compositions, providing users with a visually engaging experience reminiscent of the renowned artist's work.
